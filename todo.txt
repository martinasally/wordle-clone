âœ… clean up the dictionary so it only has 5 letter words with no punctuation.
- check if an entry is in the dictionary and fade an error message if not.
- have a button to start a new game that picks a new word.
- compare user input to word:
    - compare each letter individually
    - if letter is in the right spot keep make it green
    - if letter is in the word but in the wrong spot, make it yellow
    - if letter is not in the word, leave it grey
    - if entire word matches, then display success screen and quit
- once five turns have elapsed, display failure
